# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, 12 different green stocks are analysed for the years 2017 and 2018. We measure both the trading columnes and stocke's performance. 

At a higher-level, the objective was to create a macro that would allow large sets of stockes to be anaylzed by a finance professtional beyond the performce of the inital data set. 

## Results 
### Stock Performace 
 Let's review how the 12 green stocks performed

 We can quickly see that 2017 was a much better year for green stocks than 2018. ENPH shows postive returnes in both years. While the client initially wanted to invest exclusively in the DQ stock that may not be the strongest long term position. If they insist on pursuing a single stock stratgy, ENPH shows much stronger returns overall and the ability to weather a bad marktet. 

### Refactored Script Performance

While the orignal code got the job done, the refactored scripted ran much faster than the orignal code and would perform much better on a data set an order of magnitude larger

## Summary 
### Original Script
-Pro: It get the user the desired information

-Pro: It is easy to read and make small changes

-Con: It takes longer

-Con: It is not scalable for larger data sets

### Updated Script 
-Pro: It get the user the desired information

-Pro: It is very quick

-Pro: It would perform much better on a larger data set

-Con: It is more difficult to read
